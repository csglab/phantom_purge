Paper Title
-------

Phantom Purge: The optimal purging of phantom molecules by the robust estimation of the sample index hopping rate in multiplexed droplet-based single-cell RNA-seq data.


Summary
-------

This website hosts code and R Markdown notebooks implementing the statistical modeling approach to estimating the index hopping read in in multiplexed droplet-based single-cell RNA-seq data. The preprint detailing the method can be accessed here.
