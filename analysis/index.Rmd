Paper Title
-------

Statistical modeling, estimation, and remediation of sample index hopping in multiplexed droplet-based single-cell RNA-seq data. ([R. Farouni](http://rfarouni.github.io/) and [H. S. Najafabadi](http://csg.lab.mcgill.ca/), 2019)


Summary
-------

This website hosts code and R Markdown notebooks implementing the statistical modeling approach to estimating the sample index hopping rate and purging phantom molecules in multiplexed droplet-based single-cell RNA-seq data. The preprint detailing the method can be accessed here.
